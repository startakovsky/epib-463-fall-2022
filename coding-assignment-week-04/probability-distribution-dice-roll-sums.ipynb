Again and again. Even if it's the same problem. I encourage you to supplement your training with those sorts of exercises. For example, take the problems you were able to complete so far in this assignment. Maybe some of you could do half of them on your own - that's okay. Ask for help, try again. These are the wax ons and wax offs of learning to code. Trust me, it will get easier._\n",

In this construct you can look at the individual values in the range of the _sum_ random variable (remember that a random variable is a function). Notice how `sum_to_probability` doesn't even include the individual outcomes in the first place. What is the sum of all the values of the dictionary `sum_to_probability`? Before writing the code to this answer, what do you think it will be?"
