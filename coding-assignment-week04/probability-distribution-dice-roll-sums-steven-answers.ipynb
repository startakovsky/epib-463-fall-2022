Again and again. Even if it's the same problem. I encourage you to supplement your training with those sorts of exercises. For example, take the problems you were able to complete so far in this assignment. Maybe some of you could do half of them on your own - that's okay. Ask for help, try again. These are the wax ons and wax offs of learning to code. Trust me, it will get easier._\n",
